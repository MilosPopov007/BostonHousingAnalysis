# Predicting Boston Housing Prices: A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Overview
Welcome to an exploration journey through the Boston Housing Prices dataset! <br>
This project unleashes the power of various machine learning models to predict housing prices with a dash of explorative data analysis, model interpretation, and application building.

📈 Highlights:
* In-depth Data Analysis: Comprehensive exploration of data to unveil underlying patterns and insights.
* Advanced Predictive Modeling: Deployment and evaluation of sophisticated models to predict housing prices with high precision.
* Model Interpretation: Employing SHAP values to provide transparent and interpretable model predictions.
* Interactive Application Development: Implementation of a Flask application, providing a user interface for real-time price predictions.
