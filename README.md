# Predicting Boston Housing Prices: A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Overview
Welcome to an exploration journey through the Boston Housing Prices dataset! <br>
This project unleashes the power of various machine learning models to predict housing prices with a dash of explorative data analysis, model interpretation, and application building.

📈 Highlights:
* Advanced Modeling: Employed several machine learning models, such as RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and StackingRegressor, to predict housing prices.
* Model Interpretation: Utilized SHAP values to interpret model predictions and understand feature importances.
* Data Analysis: Conducted thorough EDA to comprehend the data and derive insights.
* Application Development: Implemented a Flask app to provide a user-friendly interface for making predictions with the developed model.
